miniatures content ~~ Austrian awards are given to Germany, but cannot be worn on the ribbon bar, as the ribbons in a suitable width and, above all, the miniatures for them are not available. We closed this gap and took the production into our own hands. The German ribbon bars can be found in our shop bottom left in the category MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

Below shop content ~~ Modular ribbon system
Below shop paragraph ~~ Ausgezeichnet<span style="color:#ED0000;">.cc</span> offers a modular ribbon system, where every ribbon is manufactured as one separety piece. The ribbons can be connected both verically and horicontally with clamping elements. When a new ribbon must be added, no parts have to be changed or thrown away, just the new ribbon has to be clipped on its place - a huge safe of money and ressources, as all once bought items can be reused and  aligned in any required way.<br>The products are fully made of high quality aluminium and stainless steel. All elements are produced with highest precisions to ensure their functionality over many years. The clutches that connect the system with the uniform are customized for Ausgezeichnet.cc - They are very flat, provide a secure fixing system and substitute needles, butterflies and other fixing systems.

miniatures content2 ~~ Miniatures
miniatures paragraph2 ~~ We put great effort into creating the miniature as close as possible to the original decoration. For production, we only use vectorized graphics of the original decoration - thus, we do not offer a "copy of a copy", but a detailled image of the original decoration, down to a size of 8mm. We proclaim the same high standards for the ribbon band grahpics -  See for yourself!

Below shop content3 ~~ The online configuraton tool
Below shop paragraph3 ~~ The online configuraton tool ranks the awards assigned to a person according to the rank order in use in Austria. These Ranking depends on the affiliation to an organization and the registerd seat (state, district, municipality) of this association. Therefore, it is necessary to provide details at registration to ensure the correct ranking of the ribbons by the configuraton tool. Registered customers can consult the configurator tool at any time without buying, to be able to clarify any questions with regard to the sometimes not easy-to-use ranking. This service, available free of charge to Ausgezeichnet.cc customers, is an absolute novelty in Austria and is nowhere else offered.

Below shop content4 ~~Grundlagen der Rangordnung
Below shop paragraph4 ~~We claim to implement the current provisions on the ranking by point and comma. The basis for this is one Variety of laws and regulations. In <a href="/RechtlicheGrundlagen.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:#ED0000;">this PDF Dokument </a> you can find several links to different medals and the correspanding laws.

Product Descriptions, Intended Use, Liability for Defects </ h1> <p> The illustrations in the webshop represent symbol images of the actual delivered items. Due to this, as well as due to technical advancements and the like. The actual delivered items may differ from these graphics. </p> <p> The items sold are for decoration purposes only. </p> <p> If unassembled items are ordered, they must be assembled by the customer. In this case, please follow the corresponding enclosed or online assembly instructions. </p> <p> Hatzmann Hell OG expressly points out that the sold items are not intended as "toys". Please take care not to be injured during assembly by improper handling.

When assembling our parts, please pay attention to clean hands and a clean working environment. There is no claim for damages on soiled parts. </p> <br> <p> Hatzmann Hell OG normally does not require proof of award for awards; the customer is responsible for fitting and carrying the clasp in accordance with the directive. It is up to the customer to observe the carrying regulations of his respective organization. </p> <p> The customer is requested to complain to the deliverer of delivered goods with obvious transport damage and to inform Hatzmann Hell OG thereof.

Conclusion of Contract, Right of Withdrawal </ h1> <p> The product descriptions contained in the online shop of Hatzmann Hell OG do not constitute binding offers by Hatzmann Hell OG.

Hatzmann Hell OG may accept the offer of the customer within five days by sending an order confirmation to the customer by e-mail, or by delivering the ordered goods to the customer, or by requesting the customer to pay after submitting his order.

The customer must ensure that the e-mail address specified by him for the order processing is correct, so that the e-mails sent by Hatzmann Hell OG can be received at this address. Customers are entitled to a 14-day right of withdrawal. The right of withdrawal does not apply to customers who, at the time of the conclusion of the contract, do not belong to any member state of the European Union and whose sole domicile and delivery address are outside the European Union at the time of conclusion of the contract. </p> <h1> 4.

When ordering from other countries, customs and shipping fees and other costs will be charged separately to the customer. The indicated prices are total prices including VAT. Delivery and shipping costs are indicated separately in the shopping cart. </p> <p> If the customer chooses prepayment by bank transfer as a payment option, the payment is due within 3 days after conclusion of the contract. </p> <p> If the payment method "SOFORT Überweisung" is selected, the payment is processed via the payment service provider SOFORT GmbH, Theresienhöhe 12, 80339 Munich (hereinafter "IMMEDIATE").
